The final ER-Diagram for the project only had one change made during the implementation process. The change was made to the
relationship between the player and college table. Unfortunately I could not find data on how many years or what major each
player had when they attended to college. Therefore, the years attribute of the Attended relationship was removed.

## Create Table Statements
Create Table Statements for the data base can be found at:[CreateTables.sql](https://github.com/caameron/CS586-GradProject/blob/master/CreateTables/CreateTable.sql)
